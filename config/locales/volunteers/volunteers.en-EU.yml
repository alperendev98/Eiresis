          <p>
          I am 22 years old and live in Bursa where I work as a react and Ruby on Rails developer.
          I cultivate passion for programming for many years and in 2009 I completed my studies in Computer Science graduating in Bologna.
          Passionate about politics and digital technologies, in July 2011 I was approached Ruby On Rails and I began to lay the foundations of the eiresis source code,
          keeping in mind an ambitious project: the creation of a software for participatory democracy.
          Fascinated by how politics is changing in recent years and by the fact that it will soon have to deal with the world wide web,
          I realized that such an instrument has never been made ​​available to citizens and so .... here I am !
          Within the project I work on coordinating the development activities and I take care of the programming itself;
          I offer support to other programmers and act as the supervisor of the source code quality.
          Moreover I help in the development of logic and in the definition of time windows and deadlines required for their completion.
